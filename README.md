# Climate Change Impact Tracker on GCP

A comprehensive, end-to-end **data engineering and analytics** solution on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to track, analyze, and forecast long-term **climate change trends** using historical temperature data and machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes global climate data, identifies extreme weather patterns, and generates predictive forecasts using **BigQuery ML** with ARIMA_PLUS models. It leverages public datasets from NOAA and NASA GISS, showcasing cloud-native architecture, advanced SQL processing, and rich visualizations in **Looker Studio**.
